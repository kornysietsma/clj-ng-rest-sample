# Things I mean to do, in no particular order.

* Generic:
** more info in the readme
* Moar angular:
** thing detailed view (new route, plus a form?)
** new things (post)
** edit things (put)
** delete things
** maybe some directives?
* more server side stuff:
** logging
** better config
** a domain namespace wrapping the repository
** some sort of lightweight DI?
** look at DropWizard for things that might be useful
** authentication/authorization
** liberator error handling
* some day / maybe:
** split into middleman-based UI and separate server, with CORS for api niceness
*** note this would mean I'd probably need a master project for end to end testing
** add more front ends - knockout.js?
** think about making this a leiningen template / wizard for building projects from scratch
** add an SQL back end?
